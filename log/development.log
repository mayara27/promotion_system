Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.

Creating scope :not_approved. Overwriting existing method Promotion.not_approved.
Enum element 'not_approved' in Promotion uses the prefix 'not_'. This has caused a conflict with auto generated negative scopes. Avoid using enum elements starting with 'not' where the positive form is also an element.
